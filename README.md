# Room-Access-Control

**Description**-

System that monitors the number of people present in a room. A photoelectric barrier at the door should recognize a person entering the room. If a maximum number of people is exceeded, a step-by-step notification system should inform about the violation of this rule. First, a small notification in the room is sufficient. If there are still too many people in the room after some time, the notification level should be increased (e.g. louder alarm sound, email notification to a responsible person, â€¦).
